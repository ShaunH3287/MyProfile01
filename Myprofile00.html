	 ...INFO..
	 My name is Shaun Hains i am currently 32 years old, i come from a Welsh and irish background although i cannot speak either of the native languages as i was born in melbourne i never really had any need, i am still 
     very much interested in the way of life through the ages in both places. i had learnt Irish dancing as child but stopped as i grew older but can still remember the moves. 
	 I am a father of 2 young children a boy and a girl
	 
     This will be my first time attending a university (Both in the real world and online) and my education level from Highschool was Year 11, although i have gone through a number of 
     courses and such to further my education when it was needed.
	 At the moment i am not involved in any sports as such as i have 2 young children and as most parents will say its a sport in it's-self.
	 Although i am fond of ice hockey and will watch whenever i get a free moment to catch up on the news and who has made it further in the season.
	</p> 
	
	<p>
	 ..INTEREST..
	 My interest in IT has always been there since a early age as computers where becoming more readily accessable to the average home user in the mid to late 1990's.
     What makes IT interesting to me is the never ending leaps and bounds we have made and are making, the way he have changed the very fabric of society through IT and it's reach is both 
	 scary and amazing, but there needs to be balance as in all things, so that aspect alone is a main reason as why im drawn to IT so much, growing up in the 90's and early 00's 
	 one can see how soon everything that we do will consist of being online and living through cables and signals, so as this inevitability draws closer i would like to have decent understanding 
	 to pass on and teach my children the things that i have picked up on and learnt over the years to help give them headstart.
	 </p>
	 
	 
	 <p>
	 ..WHY DID YOU CHOOSE RMIT..
	 I chose to come to RMIT as it has always been a part of my friends live's and family's as many have gone through the ranks over the years and i decided that it was either now or never
	 so decided to bite the bullet so to speak and do the things that i've wanted to do for many years, so choosing RMIT was a easy one considering i live in Melbourne it had always been my
	 number one choice if i was to ever enroll into a university, also to add that they offered the option that the courses can be completed online is a massive plus when time is hard to come by.
	 </p>
	 
	 
	 <p>
	 ..WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO LEARN FROM THIS..
	 The things im hoping to learn from this course in particular is everything, as cliche as that sounds i truly dont have a well thought out plan as to where i expect to go and end up from
	 so in that sense i am open to learn any and all which can be both a blessing and a issue im sure, at-least i can start off with a clean and blank slate and start from there as i dont really have any conflicting views 
	 asa i may have formed if i had been taught elsewhere and had already formed my beliefs, although with that being said i would like to take this knowledge and try to implement it into 
	 a job within the Cyber security area of the Web as that aspect really interesting in the possibilites and range of attacks, also i am eager to learn web based design, because when i was in high school i was interested in 
	 Application and Web design yet did not follow through with it unfortunatly.
	 
	 </p>
	  

     <p>
    ...IDEAL JOB...

     My ideal job would be preferably in Cyber security / Penetration tester which is something i need to spend a number of years learning and pursuing the right knowledge to be able to achieve such a dream
     yet with determination and perserverance i believe i will achieve this by learning skills such as,

     A through understanding Distro's such as Linux, Windows and Mac,
     A through understanding of programming languages such as Java, Python, C, C++, Perl, and many more,
     The correct certificates to allow one to pass the pre requisite,
     Being able to implement the skills you have been taught online into real world situations,
     By having good management skills especially in the way of using multiple tools at once to gain the information needed.

     </p>
	 
     This is a position that offers growth not only within the parent company but within the field of Cyber security itself which is appealing in many ways, 
	 The position also consists of many opportunities for further career development, such as a security auditor and penetration tester.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 ..Required Skills..
	 The skills requires some one with the capicity to use,
	 Strong logic, analytical thoughts, and the ability to communicate within a team based environment,
     The ability to deliver fact based communications not only in the verbal sense but in a written format on a daily basis,
	 Experience in Intelligence based programs such as Shadowserver, Alien Vault, Malware domains and many more.
	 The ability to give high level attention to detail.
	
	</p>
	
	 ..MY CURRENT SKILLS..
	 In the larger scheme of things required to achieve this position i do not have many of the required skill sets at this present time, apart from the ability to learn any and all required systems
	 I am currently learning Multiple Programming languages, and completing my Bachelors in Programming,
	 I can communicate with whomever is needed so i believe that i can provide the communication skills needed.
	<p>
	
	 ..HOW TO OBTAIN NEEDED SKILLS..
	 Whatever Skills that are lacking at the current moment a battle plan has been implmented to achieve a realistic number of these goals within a reasonable timeframe 
	 i am eager to learn and willing to put the time and effort in to achieve this. 
	 Currently i am in the process of bettering myself in this regard by attending university, and taking part in as many of these areas as i can.

	 <p>
	 The results to me mean that i am a somewhat introverted personality who tends to be more of a visual and auditory based individual which would be better suited in smaller based team.
	 Judging by these results, When forming a team the fact that the results point to being more introverted it would be benefecial to be placed with similar like personalities 
	 In regard to team based behaviour it would influence me to not remain so quiet and start to voice my ideas and points and to be more confident with my ideas.

	 <h3>
	....MY PROJECT IDEA....
	Using a Raspberry Pi3 to connect to a sphero robot
	</h3>
	
	
	
	
<p>
...SUMMARY...
The basic idea of this project is to be able to remotely control a sphero via a windows application and a raspberry pi 3, to be able to run via command on a endless loop as one function
And as another to be able to navigate a maze using written code, using the python language that will be run through a number of applications such as Node.js that will be connected to the raspberry pi 3, via a bluetooth link,
this will also allow a user to program a large number of commands that the sphero shall be able to run non stop 



</p>
	<p>
	Motivation 

To describe the motivators behind this idea/project would be limiting factors that the Sphero faces for such a modern and capable robot
it offers very little in the way of outside connection and manipulation which can cause a little bit of a issue as at the moment it is unable to connect to a windows PC natively
which at times can not only be frustrating but downright annoying as this limits the capabilities of the design, hopefully by using a Raspberry pi 3 i hope to be able to overcome 
these issues and make a robot that can not only be connected to windows or the personal Operating System of choice, but one that can run on a endless loop or command
the current design is almost perfect the main disadvantage is that it only has a limited space to hold in its memory by transfering it onto a pc instead of a Tablet or a smartphone
one would be able to introduce more complex commands and instructions which in turn will allow the device to do more such as run a maze using only sensors.
	
	</p>
	
	<p>
	
	Skills,

The needed skills for this project are quite readily available to be learned online, although patience will still be the best skill to posess
such as the basic understanding of the programs such as Ipython and Node.js which will allow you to code onto your raspberry pi 3 and in turn allow you to speak to the sphero via bluetooth and control it , 
also a basic understanding of the Raspberry pi would be benifecial but the program would be written such a way that even a child would be able to punch in a set of instructions, a understanding of Oval language would prove beneficial if one is to dig deep
into the framework of the Sphero it-self, otherwise a similar understanding of JavaScript would suffice, 
General knowledge of a computer will be of use if more detailed instructions are to be given but given the fact it is to be used a as a school (focusing on primary age) learning tool and toy it should not prove to be not so difficult.
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
	
	...Tools and Tech...

The tools would range from and starting with the sphero itself and the raspberry pi 3 to the multiple applications such as Raspbian jesse, TightVNC which will allow the sphero to run independently and on a program,
that could be both custom or a community based design and Node.Js which is to be installed onto the Raspberry Pi 3, Custom java code that can be written at a later date or when the project is to be implemented 
other code could be sourced off the internet if needed by those that have recently brought theirs, overall given the simplistic nature of the device it is relativly simple in its user interface, 
The main language behind this idea is to be written in JavaScript? but the main language behind the sphero itself is Oval which is based of the C language.
USB-C cord will also be needed to connect to the PC, along as a updated version of windows 10, or whatever operating system you prefer to use and are most comfortable with.

	 ...Description...
	 
	 The internet of things and one of the many uses of a raspberry pi 3 and the sphero mini,
The internet of things or the IoT as it commonly reffered to is a setup of many wireless devices that are in turn connected to internet these everyday items can be used for all sorts of things.
To start the  description off we need to first begin with the basics, starting with the robot its-self the services and features
that it comes with, the default settings do not offer much in terms of control, you can use a finger to draw a map (on Ipad) to making a map with blocks.
The sphero is its-self a miniature ball robot that is capable of performing a number of tasks from the mundane such as rolling around in figure eights, or  pre determined path that the user sets or back and forth like the robots of the past
 but with this application that  we can make our sphero robot do all sorts of things, things that were once considered too advanced for it have now become a reality,
such as runnning on a endless loop that allows the robot to navigate much more complex scenarios and terrain, such as navigating a maze with only the prebuilt sensors, or navigating  a home with sensors and a custom code,
where as before the robot was limited to the pre determined number of commands we can now control the device for longer periods.
Such as the robot can now be put in-to a  sentry mode which allows the robot to have a pre-determind map set out for the robot to follow,
The program also works with a number of models such as the BB8 model drone to the Sphero ollie and the Sphero darkside, all of which can have a fully customisable set of instructions and commands,
The user first has to download a number of applications and software to get things moving, the applications are,

Node.js  an application that allows a user to build code that acts in real time that also uses a non-blocking I/O model that allows for intensive real time applications, that will allow the device to not only remain efficent but will consume less power unlike a conventional laptop
JavaScript Programming language which allows the raspberry pi 3 to speak to the device itself.
and Ipython which will allow the user to preform endless loops, or move as desired, and with other pieces of equipment the user is able to make the robot move without touch.
Raspberry pi 3 which is a open sourced device that allows one to run programs on it not un-like a conventional PC, but given its size and capabilities it allows a user to make it a portable computer that can still run all the programs and allows you to use all its functions
such a device is needed if we are to make this a portable robot that can be used in a number of situations, but the main design was to make it run on the windows OS and to allow it have a continuous drive function to self navigate a maze as designed.


As designed one of its main features that is to be implemented is for this to be used as a learning device for students to maintain a a more hands on approach not only to design, but to also be able to use the raspberry pi 3, as a portable command centre.
Once the code has been implemented the sphero bot will be able to be either controlled via a code or more impressively via the WASD or the  arrow keys to preform more complex and nimble manouveres 
A colour scheme can also be implemented to make the Sphero more visually aesthetic to the user and it can also  dance to a music via bluetooth. Since the default colours cannot be manipulated it offered a limited array of colours and design, but once changed through the Raspberry pi 3 the combinations are endless

As designed the application was made to be able to run a maze of you're design and without human or minimal interaction by using the code we can make it sense either led sensors or IR sensors that can be used from a existing Sphero or a Playstation 4 camera sensor which allows the sphero to safely navigate most situations it finds it-self in.
The main features are the fact it can run off minimal interactions and if programed correctly, can roam around until its batterys die which for the smaller versions is around 6+ hours run-time,
The more nimble usage the WASD keys can provide to the more complex feat of completing a maze by its-self.
You can make you're Sphero do a number tricks the ramps that can be brought allow the user to program any number of commands that can allow you to race as well.
this is just a glimpse of what the power a raspberry pi and the sphero can do, and the programmable actions it allows you to preform in a simplistic manner, once this has been refined the applications will be limitless.
